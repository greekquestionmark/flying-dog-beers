also, what would you do with historical texts like marx's das kapital? i'm more a singapore type. das kapital isn't an effective example, because while it is in theory anti-nationalist, it is a critical text to all theory of economics, and a vital historic text at that so i would allow it. what i wouldn't allow is some minor writer or modern writer doing essentially the same thing, say karl kautsky or noam chomsky. they would be allowed to voice concerns about policy, but any work that undermines or slanders the nation on principle would be deliberately censored. as another example, i would allow works by the anarchist mikhail bakunin because while his theory of the state differs from that of the establishment, he was still inherently nationalist.",disability,0.7273247175303998,United States,650,190,2012-02-01,"are you familiar with the american rotc?

 a lot of anarchists are more ""rebellious teenager"", ultra-individualists, nihilists, anomists than true anarchists. for me, it was worst, most anarchists i knew was anarcho-communists, so with the antifascism, antiracism, the support of race-mixing, israel or arabs ... pfff. for example they even opposed to the family concept. nothing to do with real anarchy from the 19th century. i agree that we have to rethink about it, because the mono-nuclear family with one child, it is degenerate most than chimp society, but no family at all, nonsense. i think that anarchy is a good passageway, (to put things back flat; and to have the critical thinking) but we can not stay long anarchist ""this is in black flags that are made most beautiful shirts"".  yeah, i don't know how far individualism has sunk into the core of french or breizh values, but americans are obsessed with it. our only philosophers of note (if even that can be said) whitman and thoreau are sickeningly self-absorbed. even as an anarchist they repulsed me.  i would agree that the nuclear family with one child is degenerate only as it doesn't meant the replacement rate. otherwise, i have no problem with the nuclear family. it should remain a sub-unit of the larger family or clan, but otherwise i don't have a problem with the nuclear family. could you explain your thoughts on this matter? you are right, 19th century anarchism is an admirable ideology, and i think that not only anarchy but all revolutionary ideologies are a passageway for us. the instability of the 19th and early 20th centuries was the greatest ally of fascism and even communism. we must applaud any destabilizing force as it will pave the way for us to replace the liberal establishment.   i am against such thing like the right to vote, but petitions, control rights, right of inspection, right to propose, at less at the local level and for citizens/workers; why not ? if we select well, even a simple citizen would be from the elite. i think give citizenship only to fathers of families, with ""pure"" blood with both racial and eugenist standards, without any criminal antecedent, having performed their military service, having a job, after psychological and pyschotechnical testing ... obviously, with this select, no homosexuals, drug addicts, or young or old retarded.  that is a good point. petitions and such are acceptable, but (as we both know) this ""rulership is a human right"" is a load of malarky. i understand your views on citizenship, but i think they are too much an attempt to recreate the admirable society of ancient ie people. i would suggest that citizenship be granted to the top 10 or 20 percent of scorers on a standardized test. other avenues of citizenship would be open to those that performed community or military service. i also disagree with your feelings against homosexuality. i have no love for pride parades, but otherwise i see nothing worng with it.  i didn't say without currency, of course it is suitable, but a new form, a currency exchange, without any value in itself, so no thing like interest or usury that create values from nothing. a return to the standard.  ah ok. i misread what you said. i agree that interest is abhorrent, but i am not sure if anything more socialistic than the scandinavian system could be sustained at least until folkish consciousness has reached the levels of old.   that is why my system is subsidiarist, is the local level is not sufficien, we refer to the upper level with a planified market; belgians must sell coal and iron to indiana in exchange for corn and limestone for example. there is no problem. so you can build your airplanes ^^ like the third reich international economy : exchange and not a free market. nothing utopic.  understandable. that being said, the third reich's pan-european economic policy was hardly a model of cooperation. as much as i admire the national socialists in some regards they were german nationalist first and foremost. the pan-european rhetoric was borne out of necessity. like the actual system of liberalism  haha. very true! i think he is more for a pluriculturalism view. what exactly is pluriculturalism?

813,"understandable, but aren't you afraid that such isolation will alienate the officer from the enlisted man who in this state is probably just putting in his five years and fairly in touch with the civilian world? i ask this because i knew a west point cadet that dropped out after 9/11 because he wouldn't wait to serve his nation, and he said that wp cadets spend so much time and energy on life at wp that they have some trouble connecting with the common solider. but all of the officers would've had to go through the five years of soldiering to get their vote and the right to be an officer in the first place. doesn't the citizenship elect the multi-headed executive? therefore, if the citizenship was disproportionately military, the citizens would elect disproportionately military executives, and then the military could end up being disproportionately favored. it would be made impossibly difficult and also illegal to hold responsibilities across the three critical fields, which are the corporate sector, its upper echelons (government) and the military. if your in the position where you hold a high rank of office, that position will include tireless work in that field on threat of being demoted if quality labor is not received. a position can be held for a lifetime since it should only be possible to replace someone if they are less qualified than another pretender to that position, or have made a severe failing. it's intended that only the best hold honorable positions, and fight extremely hard to continue holding them, because such positions will indeed require a great deal of expertise or specialized knowledge, experience, intelligence and integrity. if they are not up to the task they are replaced. but by no means would it be possible or conceivable for them to work dual jobs, since the leadership positions don't entail, as they do now, sitting on a chair somewhere and discussing bullshit matters. the leadership i envision should active in the daily task of the worker and the improvement of all conditions. once again, if they are not up to this, they are to be replaced. i agree that the elite must govern, but we musn't make the mistake of simple promoting a class. the best of each class must comprise the citizenship to assure that the nation's needs are addressed. that's not how classes work. no matter to whom you are born you do not receive your citizenship and your rights for free. you have to pay for them off the sweat of your brow. therefore everyone is allowed entry into the class if they are capable. no 'class' is being promoted because a new class is being created, and re-birthed with each new generation. you misunderstand this transcendental meritocratic class system for a traditional hierarchical one. effectively it rejects all considerations of 'class' conflict and therefore even class collaboration. all of the economic marxist garbage is tossed out the window because you have a governing class that is literally the state, and a nation that is fully integrated into it. the state exists on every level, it isn't separated from the populace because it is the populace, therefore no one can exploit or abuse anyone, they'll be tossed out immediately because every position, every gear has another one that checks and corrects it, by democratic means or otherwise. i understand this may seem like splitting hairs, but could you provide a certain argument or claim by chomsky that would be across the pale in your system? i would say that what he does is policy criticism. he doesn't really mock the nation like a bill maher or some other comedians. quite simply then: chomsky allowed, maher banned. i guess the long and short of it is: would questioning the legitimacy of the state be acceptable speech in your system?

therefore, if the citizenship was disproportionately military, the citizens would elect disproportionately military executives, and then the military could end up being disproportionately favored. it would be made impossibly difficult and also illegal to hold responsibilities across the three critical fields, which are the corporate sector, its upper echelons (government) and the military. if your in the position where you hold a high rank of office, that position will include tireless work in that field on threat of being demoted if quality labor is not received. a position can be held for a lifetime since it should only be possible to replace someone if they are less qualified than another pretender to that position, or have made a severe failing. it's intended that only the best hold honorable positions, and fight extremely hard to continue holding them, because such positions will indeed require a great deal of expertise or specialized knowledge, experience, intelligence and integrity. if they are not up to the task they are replaced. but by no means would it be possible or conceivable for them to work dual jobs, since the leadership positions don't entail, as they do now, sitting on a chair somewhere and discussing bullshit matters. the leadership i envision should active in the daily task of the worker and the improvement of all conditions. once again, if they are not up to this, they are to be replaced. i agree that the elite must govern, but we musn't make the mistake of simple promoting a class. the best of each class must comprise the citizenship to assure that the nation's needs are addressed. that's not how classes work. no matter to whom you are born you do not receive your citizenship and your rights for free. you have to pay for them off the sweat of your brow. therefore everyone is allowed entry into the class if they are capable. no 'class' is being promoted because a new class is being created, and re-birthed with each new generation. you misunderstand this transcendental meritocratic class system for a traditional hierarchical one. effectively it rejects all considerations of 'class' conflict and therefore even class collaboration. all of the economic marxist garbage is tossed out the window because you have a governing class that is literally the state, and a nation that is fully integrated into it. the state exists on every level, it isn't separated from the populace because it is the populace, therefore no one can exploit or abuse anyone, they'll be tossed out immediately because every position, every gear has another one that checks and corrects it, by democratic means or otherwise. i understand this may seem like splitting hairs, but could you provide a certain argument or claim by chomsky that would be across the pale in your system? i would say that what he does is policy criticism. he doesn't really mock the nation like a bill maher or some other comedians. quite simply then: chomsky allowed, maher banned. i guess the long and short of it is: would questioning the legitimacy of the state be acceptable speech in your system?

i have considered this as a possibility though, which is why the administration for military affairs (this is the civilian government, not the head generals and officer class) is made up of appointees from the various industries, and make decisions on military affairs in the name of the state, not the officer class. only their executive is directly elected by the voters: they are first selected as representatives of their industries in parliament and then selected by parliament to run the military administration jointly with the officer class. therefore it could be one of the representatives from fishing, another from tractor manufacturing, another from fertilizer production etc. the system is then corrupted into a classist state. i would say the biggest problem in america isn't that bankers are senators and his son is a colonel (although that happens and it is fucking enraging), but that rockefeller, kennedy, and powell are in the same country club or all own an island in the same archipelago. your system seriously cuts back on this by making citizenship a non-inheritable trait, but how is kennedy going to evaluate rockefeller's son when he knows rockefeller from the syndicate council meetings and executive elections. every system gives leeway to corruption, its just one of those things thats impossible to control. bear in mind however that all of these people will now have a much harder time because of the purely meritocratic structure and all the checks and balances now in place. so in this case, the banker knows a senator or whatever, but they now both have responsibilities to 1 voters 2 superiors 3 each other, that if aren't met, will end in their replacement. its much harder to sign some sort of deal that way. plus i never mentioned the secret police... probably because i'm not sure who to give that responsibility. obviously, the system has flaws, probably because it isn't fully developed yet, and while i've put a lot of thought into it, what it'll never be is complete. problems and flaws are inevitable, and obviously, based on this as well as how history simply flows, there will be natural kinks in it that will need repair, once (if ever) implemented. this is natural, and the inevitability of every political system. just as an example, the us has had one fixed government for its whole history- how much has that government changed over the years, to adapt to social change?
