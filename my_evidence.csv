5827,"that‚Äôs a pretty ridiculous attitude to take if you ask me. this country is bound to break up if any of the races which came here are to survive. the fact is that at this point we cannot deport all of the non-european types out of here, so i think we need to give them different parts of the country for themselves. it‚Äôs the only solution really, even if we could deport everyone we wanted to, we would lose a lot of the population and it might cripple the economy if done too quickly. i once theorized that it could be done successfully if we did it slowly and gradually enough, but i think that it is best to break up the u.s. at this point into different racial homelands. i agree with this. i think the united states should be broken up and different racial groups given their own homogeneous homelands possibly subject to european hegemony possibly given full control over their own states. the one guy in here said that america is the new rome like it is a good thing, as racialists that should be a bad thing for us. rome was degenerate and multi-racial not to mention overly-imperialist especially towards their own indo-european brothers. just to note, else christensen had to go hiding because the national socialists suspected her of being part of the danish resistance, not because she was a heathen. true, though else christensen did raise some objections to the hitler regime like strasser and i think that is what got her and her husband in trouble. it is my opinion that hitler surrounded himself around too many esoterics such as himmler and the order of thule. he wasn't even very fond of asatru/germanic heathenry. ""on the contrary, it is entirely out of harmony with the spirit of the nation to keep harping on that far-off and forgotten nomenclature which belongs to the ancient germanic times and does not awaken any distinct association in our age. this habit of borrowing words from the dead past tends to mislead the people into thinking that the external trappings of its vocabulary are the important feature of a movement. it is really a mischievous habit; but it is quite prevalent nowadays"" - quoted from mein kampf personally i think email is easier, but if you want to stick around here i guess that‚Äôs okay. but i hate this forum because most of the audience is not even open to the views i want to present. i would like to be on a site on which i know i am speaking to people who will actually take me seriously and think about what i have to say. on this site, i swear it‚Äôs as if everybody is either a soldier or a gangster (i.e. a grunt who just wants everyone to just march in line). this place is also sort of like vnn, it‚Äôs a vulgar, online version of a male locker room full of ‚Äútough guys‚Äù who like to beat each other up. i didn't know e-mail was easier for you, we could revert back to that if you like. just shoot me an e-mail in reply if you wish. i would have to say that even stormfront or enat could be considered better than this site because at least those sites have a lot of ignorant people that simply don't know much and can be taught. it seems as if everyone here or on sp is either an intellectual reactionary or internationalist. it‚Äôs interesting, ""blood over borders"" nationalism. i think that was exactly what i was trying to teach you back on socialist phalanx when you rejected race for a minute there. it is easy to get disillusioned when considering the cosmopolitan makeup of our nations today. tribalism, which is what i adhere to, or being a crazy reactionary and simply believing in a nation because it happens to be there are really the only answers to globalism. i am not even sure i like the word nationalist, as it implies separating europeans on stupid grounds such as different anthems, flags, and lines in the ground when we are really all part of one big family and should unite. i would like to see a united states of europe one day as strasser advocated for. what do you like about julius evola? there are only a few things i like about evola, but i kind of hate his overall philosophy. in essence, he argues that we should all live in stratified, patriarchal caste societies which he justifies using some occult bullshit ideas. he also denounces a lot of spiritual beliefs i have as being ‚Äúlunar.‚Äù most of what he calls lunar spirituality is good stuff (although that‚Äôs not to say that what he calls solar is bad).to elaborate, evola‚Äôs teachings obviously have some positive aspects from a conservative racialist-nationalist perspective, especially in his criticisms of the enemies. you‚Äôre already aware that his teachings on race had some influence on my thinking (although i might say that he is simultaneously somewhat misleading when it comes to race as well). however, i find his doctrine as a whole unacceptable, especially his idea of tradition. what he calls ‚Äútradition‚Äù is actually a mixture of practices and beliefs which are not always actually part of what i consider to be proper traditional aryan practices, even though a few of them are. evola takes things too far; the ancient european way of life did include a hierarchical society ruled by a monarch, but this elite was folkish (i.e. to love the people as a whole) and socialistic, even though it practiced a simplistic tribal form of socialism. it was not some rigid caste system with an aristocracy obsessing over strange spiritual ideas which no one really believed (an example of what i‚Äôm thinking of is evola‚Äôs idea that we need to be ‚Äúinitiated‚Äù to become immortal and the whole ‚Äúsolar‚Äù/‚Äúlunar‚Äù distinction, which is something i believe he is really wrong about).  i, too, actually share your criticisms. i think he is too obsessed with eastern occultism and caste systems; though i like his criticisms of modern society and i consider myself a traditionalist to a degree. throughout my readings of strasser and evola i have found some common connections between their ideologies and found some inspiration in that. both want to return to a more traditional european society and strasser based his socialism on a traditional european guild system where hierarchy is completely necessary and left in tact. he, unlike evola, propounds the need to root out injustices of such a system and actually gives us idea how we could develop such a system out of the ruins of degenerate capitalism. interesting, i remember when i first informed you about the captain, i first felt as though you sort of didn‚Äôt think much of him. now you list him as a major inspiration.did you happen to read the essays i sent to you yet? any comments or questions?  upon returning to a more folkish based nationalism i re-read some parts of ""for my legionaries"". i found some inspiration in it, such as what codreanu was trying to do with the national christian socialist movement much like what strasser was trying to do - trying to provide oppressed workers with an alternative to bolshevism. however, i believe nowadays it is necessary considering the depths of depravity the liberal capitalist system has plunged our nations into to support activities such as strikes as strasser did and harness that revolutionary potential into something nationalistic. for example, like when codreanu went around and removed the communist flags from the factories and replaced them with romanian ones - i have no desire to go around ripping down commie flags and replacing them with american ones. perhaps with a new banner for our people, but i could care less about the american flag to be honest. i did manage to read your essays, by the way. i enjoyed them especially the biography as it recapped a lot of what i read and what i actually forgot from ""for my legionaries"". i do have one question, i have always had a curiosity about the man constantin pancu. i thought the whole fighting circle thing and him coming out on top was grand. do you have more information on him? also, on a side note, i happen to have found romanian lyrics for those legionary songs i sent to you in the past and i think i can translate them. in the past i didn‚Äôt have the lyrics and i couldn‚Äôt translate the songs because i couldn‚Äôt quite hear what they were saying exactly. but now i am able to see what the songs say and i can give you the lyrics in english when i have some spare time to translate. great to hear, i will gladly see the english lyrics when you have time. on a side note, have you heard this song?

5721,"are you familiar with the american rotc? if so, how do you see it as a model for training officers? its a poor one at best. officer's training should be done at a professional academy and through a very wide range of academic, physical and military activities who totally immerse the student for a very long period of time. i'm thinking something like an entire year in total isolation from the civilian world and mostly confined within a company of men, sometimes the battalion. if you like you can compare it to the course at the united states naval academy (annapolis maryland) except the training would have a much broader volume and density, and of course add in the isolation from all things non-military. but this all isn't exactly relevant to republics and such. as soon as some segment of society becomes more represented in the electorate than they are population the risk is run of that group becoming the parasite class. i think that for obvious reasons, that wouldn't happen. this parasite class isn't given any advantages, only more responsibilities- they have no more ""rights"" than the average citizen, in fact they're supposed to be economically less sound, and in fact have weaker finances because of high taxation, unless they are extraordinarily hard workers. what i think is that you missed the whole point of instituting such a program of citizenship. it isn't to make democracy work and finally realize the long-lost dream of one of your founding fathers, to have a truly egalitarian, functional system of rights or whatever, like the american republic which holds civil rights to the highest mantle of virtue. i don't believe in any of that nonsense. the goal of this whole thing is to create an elite to govern all society. that this elite is a broad range of average people is a functional reason, that it's much more effective to have a very large pool of decent governors, well integrated and well connected to every single community in the country than it is to have a very high quality but very thin volume elite of governors, ruling in a centralized, autocratic fashion. giving people some rights that are considered 'democratic' isn't to create a truly democratic system, because that isn't the goal here. the goal is meritocracy and syndicalism, the function of holding votes or polls, and having something of a constitution, principle of citizenship etc, all serves to this end, and to the end of effectively facilitating the integration of all mass energies and indeed, of the entire population into the state. a certain level of autonomy and democracy are necessary for this process because only then will you have a fluid, flexible, self-correcting system. would you say turkey's current level of freedom of expression is one you would be comfortable with? also, what would you do with historical texts like marx's das kapital? i'm more a singapore type. das kapital isn't an effective example, because while it is in theory anti-nationalist, it is a critical text to all theory of economics, and a vital historic text at that so i would allow it. what i wouldn't allow is some minor writer or modern writer doing essentially the same thing, say karl kautsky or noam chomsky. they would be allowed to voice concerns about policy, but any work that undermines or slanders the nation on principle would be deliberately censored. as another example, i would allow works by the anarchist mikhail bakunin because while his theory of the state differs from that of the establishment, he was still inherently nationalist.",familiar american rotc see model training officer poor one best officer training professional academy wide range academic physical military activity totally immerse student long period time think something like entire year total isolation civilian world mostly confine within company man sometimes battalion like compare course united states naval academy annapolis maryland except training would much broad volume density course add isolation thing non military exactly relevant republic soon segment society become represent electorate population risk run group become parasite class think obvious reason would happen parasite class give advantage responsibilities right average citizen fact suppose economically less sound fact weak finance high taxation unless extraordinarily hard worker think miss whole point institute program citizenship make democracy work finally realize long lose dream one found father truly egalitarian functional system right whatever like american republic hold civil right high mantle virtue believe nonsense goal whole thing create elite govern society elite broad range average people functional reason much effective large pool decent governor well integrated well connected every single community country high quality thin volume elite governor rule centralized autocratic fashion give people right consider democratic create truly democratic system goal goal meritocracy syndicalism function hold vote poll something constitution principle citizenship etc serve end end effectively facilitate integration mass energy indeed entire population state certain level autonomy democracy necessary process fluid flexible self correct system would say turkey current level freedom expression one would comfortable also would historical text like marx das kapital singapore type das kapital effective example theory anti nationalist critical text theory economic vital historic text would allow would allow minor writer modern writer essentially thing say karl kautsky noam chomsky would allow voice concern policy work undermine slander nation principle would deliberately censor another example would allow work anarchist mikhail bakunin theory state differ establishment still inherently nationalist,0,0,disability,0.7273247175303998

5724,"i wouldn't consider ncos officers either. in the us army an enlisted man can go to ocs and receive his commission as a 2nd lieutenant.i agree that you have to strenuously test the mettle and skill of prospective officers, but i think precautions also need to be taken that the process doesn't scare away too many people. the last thing we want is an army with too few officers.  in reality, it's much preferable to have a force of enlisted who can self-organize and have utilities of leadership within the smallest units. this is why i'm a fan of the us marine corps. the point is, the brunt of the six years training an officer gets is doing the same thing as that of a soldier: five years are dedicated to basic service. officer must be a soldier first. the rest that it actually literally takes to become an officer is best employing the skills learned in these five years, plus of course a college degree somewhere. it will take much more than your average joe to pass the officer's trials, which should be very traditional/ritualistic but extremely rigorous and academic as well. however the only officer's training is the year's seclusion from all civilian life. it's only one year, a difficult year of course, with a lot of underpinnings or difficulties to get there, much less pass, but purely time wise it isn't that long. and once again, if that one year is too much a sacrifice, then we probably don't need your kind in the officer corps. the job of all this is to dissuade not persuade people from joining the military, so that only the most bold and daring will ever make it. like i said, there's plenty of thought i put into this  when you talking about parliament running the army jointly with the officer corps are you talking about a civilian head of the military or something more pervasive? civilian team of administrators appointed by the congress. i'm not sure how exactly the responsibilities will be distributed, but there will definitely be civilians organizing the state affairs of the military. these however will not be granted the task of promoting or demoting high officers, this will fall on the highest council of the nation itself. ah, the secret police! now this sounds interesting. i assume they would be in charge of making sure that citizens are not abusing their position for private gain and that unrest is not being fomented among the general population. is this correct? would they have any special powers beyond your regular police or would they just be plain-clothed policemen with additional training?  i'm not quite sure about these either. i'm thinking now they will only be spies tasked with delivering information to the police, who would then be tasked with resolving whatever issue, and will in fact be the only centralized form of law enforcement since i believe legal matters should be handled strictly locally. don't get me wrong, there would be intercommunication between regions to effectively deal with inter-state crime, but centralization in this respect breeds corruption of the highest order. secret police should work as a part of the police, which are part of the municipal government, therefore have autonomy in the central government, (elected by the populace directly) however since they're a centralized utility they should be organized by one department of the centralized government. which one?

5912,"i wanted to keep my promise by not replying in the jew thread, but you said some things in it that interested me and were worthy of a response. and since you were one of the more thoughtful posters i wanted to reply somehow. also because some of your post confused me.  your example does bring up the issue, which relates even to your 'jewishness'. when it comes down to it, if the healthy part of jewish values are compatible with the german, are they not one in the same?[/quote]if the healthy part of christian values are compatible with the german, are they not one in the same? but, i would have to ask you what you think german values are. if german values are industry, production, and innovation, then jewish secular culture has always been this. austrian emperors such as franz joseph preferred jews in business over others because he knew they had been good for the empire. i cannot deny the massive contribution judaism has made to german culture. or that german jews are partly responsible for the existence of germany in the first place. when people mention jewish values and ""german"" values, they confuse me. especially since secular jewish culture in germany has always considered itself german, just not christian german. it went so far that german jews thought they were superior to any other group of jews. often jewish non-germans were discriminated against by german jews. being german and being jewish were never mutually exclusive. this is a concept invented by radical national socialists only, and was often opposed by germans in austria, switzerland, and elsewhere. it seems to me that the knowledge of history for many non-germans ends with hitler. many do not know, for example, that many germans considered themselves prussian or bavarian (not german)--as austrians today consider themselves austrian. or they forget deutschland was a political union of states. people did not agree as much then on what a german was as they do today. when the states were unified, being a german was a somewhat new idea. and german values a vague concept. --------------------------------- but mostly i do not understand how if i were christian this would be considered german without question. even though i find mainly non-germans think german jews are less german than german christians. most real nationalistic germans today are proud of the long list of german jewish scientists, doctors, and otherwise geniuses that advanced and continue to advance germany even today. because they were german. from everything you've written, i have to say that there is no way i can consider you to be a jew, in terms of what jew means to me.[/quote]maybe your beliefs on what a jew is are unrealistic. i feel this may be the case when i see mentions of ""talmud"" and pharisee. many jews don't use a talmud. they reject it as legitimate. for example, karaite jews. also ""talmudist"" and pharisee are meaningless words. if you want to refer to jews like that, then i think you are referring to either orthodox or hasidim. but most jews are not hasidic or orthodox. as for my jewishness. i resent that if i were christian, this would be a non-issue. i also consider this to be nonsense. as far as actual religion goes, judaism is more logical than christianity is anyway. christianity is built on self-contradicting truths. so the pro-christian argument for being german is absolute nonsense to me. i am sorry to say, but if all germans had always been christian, germany would have had far fewer advances. the only way i can relate communism doctrinally to modern judaism is the materialism.[/quote]still doesn't make sense. only jewish secular culture is materialistic. as is all secular culture--although secular jews may be better at it than secular christians. jewish religious culture suggests owning things is a bad thing, and that charity is more useful. the christian monk aesthetic is a jewish aesthetic. i think it is a matter of cultural nepotism, so even though i don't see jews as a race, i recognize that their cultural and social identity amounts to a 'racial' identity in practice.[/quote]i consider christians a race in that way too. so ok. i know people in my family who would argue moreover that catholics are often anti-german and representative of foreign italian/roman/vatican power. and yet i am willing to accept german catholics as german, although some jews in my family consider them completely non-german and instead dedicated to roman catholic power. so, i say communism was either a golem of certain jews or simply a vehicle to gain power.[/quote]nonsense. communism was a plague inflicted on judaism. jews were constantly trying to leave the ussr. i'm sure we agree that jewish identity factored into communist revolutions, since it is apparently a variant of judaism.[/quote]we don't agree on that. i'm sure that the national jews you describe have overlapped at some point with the marxists.[/quote]no, jewish zionism has no place in marxism. which is why marx opposed zionism and hated jews. he opposed religion. and for many jews, even if they are atheist, the religion is still valid and they raise their children jewish.

5874,"hej, how are you my friend ? i am pretty good. started a second job over the weekend. i'll be chasing my tail for the next eight weeks, but it'll put a serious dent in my student loans. so i am very excited! how about yourself? how is life treating you?  it happened because of my father, he is the real language lover in my family, so i grew up surronded by books about languages. i think that is celtic languages that fascinates me the most, goidelic or brythonic, and after out of ie language, the mandarin.  you are a lucky chap! is he a professor, diplomat, or just a curious guy? i am impressed that you have studied mandarin. i tend to stick with the latin alphabet anytime i can. haha. how interested are you in historical languages? how big is the gulf between goidelic and brythonic languages?  a lot of anarchists are more ""rebellious teenager"", ultra-individualists, nihilists, anomists than true anarchists. for me, it was worst, most anarchists i knew was anarcho-communists, so with the antifascism, antiracism, the support of race-mixing, israel or arabs ... pfff. for example they even opposed to the family concept. nothing to do with real anarchy from the 19th century. i agree that we have to rethink about it, because the mono-nuclear family with one child, it is degenerate most than chimp society, but no family at all, nonsense. i think that anarchy is a good passageway, (to put things back flat; and to have the critical thinking) but we can not stay long anarchist ""this is in black flags that are made most beautiful shirts"".  yeah, i don't know how far individualism has sunk into the core of french or breizh values, but americans are obsessed with it. our only philosophers of note (if even that can be said) whitman and thoreau are sickeningly self-absorbed. even as an anarchist they repulsed me.  i would agree that the nuclear family with one child is degenerate only as it doesn't meant the replacement rate. otherwise, i have no problem with the nuclear family. it should remain a sub-unit of the larger family or clan, but otherwise i don't have a problem with the nuclear family. could you explain your thoughts on this matter? you are right, 19th century anarchism is an admirable ideology, and i think that not only anarchy but all revolutionary ideologies are a passageway for us. the instability of the 19th and early 20th centuries was the greatest ally of fascism and even communism. we must applaud any destabilizing force as it will pave the way for us to replace the liberal establishment.   i am against such thing like the right to vote, but petitions, control rights, right of inspection, right to propose, at less at the local level and for citizens/workers; why not ? if we select well, even a simple citizen would be from the elite. i think give citizenship only to fathers of families, with ""pure"" blood with both racial and eugenist standards, without any criminal antecedent, having performed their military service, having a job, after psychological and pyschotechnical testing ... obviously, with this select, no homosexuals, drug addicts, or young or old retarded.  that is a good point. petitions and such are acceptable, but (as we both know) this ""rulership is a human right"" is a load of malarky. i understand your views on citizenship, but i think they are too much an attempt to recreate the admirable society of ancient ie people. i would suggest that citizenship be granted to the top 10 or 20 percent of scorers on a standardized test. other avenues of citizenship would be open to those that performed community or military service. i also disagree with your feelings against homosexuality. i have no love for pride parades, but otherwise i see nothing worng with it.  i didn't say without currency, of course it is suitable, but a new form, a currency exchange, without any value in itself, so no thing like interest or usury that create values from nothing. a return to the standard.  ah ok. i misread what you said. i agree that interest is abhorrent, but i am not sure if anything more socialistic than the scandinavian system could be sustained at least until folkish consciousness has reached the levels of old.   that is why my system is subsidiarist, is the local level is not sufficien, we refer to the upper level with a planified market; belgians must sell coal and iron to indiana in exchange for corn and limestone for example. there is no problem. so you can build your airplanes ^^ like the third reich international economy : exchange and not a free market. nothing utopic.  understandable. that being said, the third reich's pan-european economic policy was hardly a model of cooperation. as much as i admire the national socialists in some regards they were german nationalist first and foremost. the pan-european rhetoric was borne out of necessity. like the actual system of liberalism  haha. very true! i think he is more for a pluriculturalism view. what exactly is pluriculturalism?    i am always encouraged when i hear about pagans networking. while i am no pagan yet, it is an honorable and noble tradition. the world would be better off with more pagans. and best with only pagans   very true! the true tragedy of modern paganism is that it is separated from the family due to the fact that it is no longer the dominant societal belief system. it would be great to see society return to the old religion. i am not a particularly spiritual person, but i would gladly join a community that advocates the veneration of ancestors. we owe them everything in the literal sense of the word.",hej friend pretty good start second job weekend chase tail next eight week put serious dent student loan excited life treat happen father real language lover family grow surronde book language think celtic language fascinate goidelic brythonic ie language mandarin lucky chap professor diplomat curious guy impressed study mandarin tend stick latin alphabet anytime haha interested historical language big gulf goidelic brythonic language lot anarchist rebellious teenager ultra individualist nihilist anomist true anarchist bad anarchist know anarcho communist antifascism antiracism support race mix israel arabs pfff example even oppose family concept nothing real anarchy th century agree rethink mono nuclear family one child degenerate chimp society family nonsense think anarchy good passageway put thing back flat critical thinking stay long anarchist black flag make beautiful shirt yeah know far individualism sink core french breizh value americans obsess philosopher note even say whitman thoreau sickeningly self absorb even anarchist repulse would agree nuclear family one child degenerate meant replacement rate otherwise problem nuclear family remain sub unit large family clan otherwise problem nuclear family could explain thought matter right th century anarchism admirable ideology think anarchy revolutionary ideology passageway us instability th early th century great ally fascism even communism must applaud destabilizing force pave way us replace liberal establishment thing like right vote petition control right right inspection right propose less local level citizen worker select well even simple citizen would elite think give citizenship father family pure blood racial eugenist standard without criminal antecedent perform military service job psychological pyschotechnical testing obviously select homosexual drug addict young old retard good point petition acceptable know rulership human right load malarky understand view citizenship think much attempt recreate admirable society ancient ie people would suggest citizenship grant top percent scorer standardized test avenue citizenship would open perform community military service also disagree feeling homosexuality love pride parade otherwise see nothing worng say without currency course suitable new form currency exchange without value thing like interest usury create value nothing return standard ah ok misread say agree interest abhorrent sure anything socialistic scandinavian system could sustain least folkish consciousness reach level old system subsidiarist local level sufficien refer upper level planifie market belgian must sell coal iron indiana exchange corn limestone example problem build airplane like third reich international economy exchange free market nothing utopic understandable say third reichs pan european economic policy hardly model cooperation much admire national socialist regard german nationalist first foremost pan european rhetoric bear necessity like actual system liberalism haha true think pluriculturalism view exactly pluriculturalism always encourage hear pagan network pagan yet honorable noble tradition world would well pagan good pagan true true tragedy modern paganism separate family due fact longer dominant societal belief system would great see society return old religion particularly spiritual person would gladly join community advocate veneration ancestor owe everything literal sense word,0,0,origin,0.9088566071958629

5722,"understandable, but aren't you afraid that such isolation will alienate the officer from the enlisted man who in this state is probably just putting in his five years and fairly in touch with the civilian world? i ask this because i knew a west point cadet that dropped out after 9/11 because he wouldn't wait to serve his nation, and he said that wp cadets spend so much time and energy on life at wp that they have some trouble connecting with the common solider. but all of the officers would've had to go through the five years of soldiering to get their vote and the right to be an officer in the first place. doesn't the citizenship elect the multi-headed executive? therefore, if the citizenship was disproportionately military, the citizens would elect disproportionately military executives, and then the military could end up being disproportionately favored. it would be made impossibly difficult and also illegal to hold responsibilities across the three critical fields, which are the corporate sector, its upper echelons (government) and the military. if your in the position where you hold a high rank of office, that position will include tireless work in that field on threat of being demoted if quality labor is not received. a position can be held for a lifetime since it should only be possible to replace someone if they are less qualified than another pretender to that position, or have made a severe failing. it's intended that only the best hold honorable positions, and fight extremely hard to continue holding them, because such positions will indeed require a great deal of expertise or specialized knowledge, experience, intelligence and integrity. if they are not up to the task they are replaced. but by no means would it be possible or conceivable for them to work dual jobs, since the leadership positions don't entail, as they do now, sitting on a chair somewhere and discussing bullshit matters. the leadership i envision should active in the daily task of the worker and the improvement of all conditions. once again, if they are not up to this, they are to be replaced. i agree that the elite must govern, but we musn't make the mistake of simple promoting a class. the best of each class must comprise the citizenship to assure that the nation's needs are addressed. that's not how classes work. no matter to whom you are born you do not receive your citizenship and your rights for free. you have to pay for them off the sweat of your brow. therefore everyone is allowed entry into the class if they are capable. no 'class' is being promoted because a new class is being created, and re-birthed with each new generation. you misunderstand this transcendental meritocratic class system for a traditional hierarchical one. effectively it rejects all considerations of 'class' conflict and therefore even class collaboration. all of the economic marxist garbage is tossed out the window because you have a governing class that is literally the state, and a nation that is fully integrated into it. the state exists on every level, it isn't separated from the populace because it is the populace, therefore no one can exploit or abuse anyone, they'll be tossed out immediately because every position, every gear has another one that checks and corrects it, by democratic means or otherwise. i understand this may seem like splitting hairs, but could you provide a certain argument or claim by chomsky that would be across the pale in your system? i would say that what he does is policy criticism. he doesn't really mock the nation like a bill maher or some other comedians. quite simply then: chomsky allowed, maher banned. i guess the long and short of it is: would questioning the legitimacy of the state be acceptable speech in your system? critique of some policy or some politician is allowed. critique of the state as an entity, it's mantle as the supreme head of the nation, and its fundamental organization of national syndicalist can not be put under question. reform and such can be discussed on the upper echelons of the state syndicates, but these are directly elected by those most devoted and committed, those that have sacrificed most for their country, therefore the 'people's' voice is heard anyway.",understandable afraid isolation alienate officer enlisted man state probably put five year fairly touch civilian world ask know west point cadet drop would wait serve nation say wp cadet spend much time energy life wp trouble connect common solider officer would go five year soldier get vote right officer first place citizenship elect multi headed executive therefore citizenship disproportionately military citizen would elect disproportionately military executive military could end disproportionately favor would make impossibly difficult also illegal hold responsibility across three critical field corporate sector upper echelon government military position hold high rank office position include tireless work field threat demote quality labor receive position hold lifetime since possible replace someone less qualified another pretender position make severe failing intend good hold honorable position fight extremely hard continue hold position indeed require great deal expertise specialized knowledge experience intelligence integrity task replace means would possible conceivable work dual job since leadership position entail sit chair somewhere discuss bullshit matter leadership envision active daily task worker improvement condition replace agree elite must govern musnt make mistake simple promote class good class must comprise citizenship assure nation need address class work matter bear receive citizenship right free pay sweat brow therefore everyone allow entry class capable class promote new class create birth new generation misunderstand transcendental meritocratic class system traditional hierarchical one effectively reject consideration class conflict therefore even class collaboration economic marxist garbage toss window govern class literally state nation fully integrate state exist every level separate populace populace therefore one exploit abuse anyone toss immediately every position every gear another one check correct democratic mean otherwise understand may seem like splitting hair could provide certain argument claim chomsky would across pale system would say policy criticism really mock nation like bill maher comedian quite simply chomsky allow maher ban guess long short would question legitimacy state acceptable speech system critique policy politician allow critique state entity mantle supreme head nation fundamental organization national syndicalist put question reform discuss upper echelon state syndicate directly elect devoted committed sacrifice country therefore people voice hear anyway,0,0,origin,0.5224424876101282

(much of this was done without hitler's knowledge. hitler approved of them being sent east, but he did not want them killed). obviously something happened though. the jewish population of germany and poland shrunk. i think 6 million is bad, but it is not so bad. stalin killed many times this number, but liberal jews today monopolize wwii to say they were the only or primary victims. i am not sure i agree with this, however i understand they did it to gain support for a jewish state (which ultimately has become non-jewish, causing radical jews to want to secede from israel and create judea). so, though it is somewhat unfair to everyone who suffered, they are being smart. what can i read regarding prussian socialism? what literature supported your thought?",indeed like strasser write much early ideology decide become radical forum also strange full nazi fetish naziism pragmatic course mostly american probably post like idea educate suppose national socialist national socialism actually stand nazis become popular hate jews seem pointless give history forum people supposedly nazis would though expose fact people think national socialist really american neo nazi view national socialism come medium tv video game instead thing like mein kampf triumph des willens wirtschaftliche sofortprogramm der nsdap like israel see problem people say israelis steal palestinian land well russians steal german land americans steal indian land english take ireland palestinians never country anyway british ottomans rule find amusing people hate liberalism often support liberalism anti israel holocaust think many story probably exaggerated eyewitness account talk jews send train east shoot put pit gas much without hitler knowledge hitler approve send east want kill obviously something happen though jewish population germany poland shrunk think million bad bad stalin kill many time number liberal jews today monopolize wwii say primary victim sure agree however understand gain support jewish state ultimately become non jewish cause radical jews want secede israel create judea though somewhat unfair everyone suffer smart read regard prussian socialism literature support thought,0,0,gender,0.5651251750510959

5723,"that would certainly make them relatable, but i'd say lower the time they spend in the ranks. 6+ years is a long-ass time to earn your commission. i think an enlisted soldier could enter officer candidate school in america and have their commission in two years. i don't consider nco's officers. likewise, the trial should be hard, bearing in mind how much of an influential and critical position the officer class holds. they should never forget the sort of price they paid for the position, since the goal isn't to pursuade everyone to try and apply, rather, it's the opposite. my fear on the corruption of this system isn't that people will come to hold multiple positions, but that some group will be over-represented. for example, soldiers get a plurality in the citizenship and then vote for lowering the military requirements. why would they do that when they already have the vote? i have considered this as a possibility though, which is why the administration for military affairs (this is the civilian government, not the head generals and officer class) is made up of appointees from the various industries, and make decisions on military affairs in the name of the state, not the officer class. only their executive is directly elected by the voters: they are first selected as representatives of their industries in parliament and then selected by parliament to run the military administration jointly with the officer class. therefore it could be one of the representatives from fishing, another from tractor manufacturing, another from fertilizer production etc. the system is then corrupted into a classist state. i would say the biggest problem in america isn't that bankers are senators and his son is a colonel (although that happens and it is fucking enraging), but that rockefeller, kennedy, and powell are in the same country club or all own an island in the same archipelago. your system seriously cuts back on this by making citizenship a non-inheritable trait, but how is kennedy going to evaluate rockefeller's son when he knows rockefeller from the syndicate council meetings and executive elections. every system gives leeway to corruption, its just one of those things thats impossible to control. bear in mind however that all of these people will now have a much harder time because of the purely meritocratic structure and all the checks and balances now in place. so in this case, the banker knows a senator or whatever, but they now both have responsibilities to 1 voters 2 superiors 3 each other, that if aren't met, will end in their replacement. its much harder to sign some sort of deal that way. plus i never mentioned the secret police... probably because i'm not sure who to give that responsibility. obviously, the system has flaws, probably because it isn't fully developed yet, and while i've put a lot of thought into it, what it'll never be is complete. problems and flaws are inevitable, and obviously, based on this as well as how history simply flows, there will be natural kinks in it that will need repair, once (if ever) implemented. this is natural, and the inevitability of every political system. just as an example, the us has had one fixed government for its whole history- how much has that government changed over the years, to adapt to social change?

7067," thanks for the quick response! i see your point now.   so the problem with a group like isis is that they themselves don't understand islam's inner essence, but only the outer substance that has been added to it over 1400 years. and furthermore, they also want to destroy much of that outer substance, which would ultimately just create a black hole because there'd be almost nothing left of islam. thus, the end result (the inevitable conclusion) of a group acting like isis won't be the final unification of islam, but rather it will be the protestantization of the religion into tens of thousands of different denominations. in other words: isis won't end up unifying islam or returning the muslim world to its roots (even though that's what they want), because they themselves don't have the spiritual strength to do so. but instead, they are just breaking islam up and will eventually cause its demise just like what the protestants did with christianity. that's what you mean, right?   and this line really stood out to me:    36 minutes ago, vasiszta said:    these people are unable to see the essence what unites, only the substance what divides, that's why every reformation led to mindless conflict.     again, this just keeps reminding me of the protestants. how did you end up with 40000 different protestant denominations? i suppose that is what happened: in their efforts for reformation, the protestants just saw the dividing substance, but not the uniting essence. even though they wanted purity and reformation, and they said they were returning christianity to its true roots, in reality they themselves simply didn't have the spiritual strength to carry out such a monumental task, and so protestantism just ended up serving whatever local and personal interests the people within the various groups had.   this also reminds me of a saying from the buddha:   ""in a world become blind, i beat the drum of the deathless.""   isn't he basically talking about involution here? he's essentially saying he's returning to the truth, which is also what the protestants claimed, but the difference here is that the buddha actually did have the spiritual strength to carry out such a task, and that's why he was successful. would you say that's a fair example? it's also interesting that the buddha did both of the two things that you mentioned: he did it all by bettering himself, and he also didn't care if others followed him or not.   - - - - -   but then, this raises another question in my mind: what about someone like hitler, who eventually did force people to follow him? i mean, hitler certainly qualified for your 1st requirement (bettering himself); however, he certainly didn't qualify for your 2nd one (at least when it came to the masses). and i know the whole thing about having a temporary period of forcing others to listen to you until the organic state is created, but this is now more from a political perspective than a religious one. i mean, remember ustryalov's ""violence can't save a dying idea blah blah"". is that what you mean here? or is that a whole different issue?   also, obviously in a fascist state there are always going to be lots of things you would force people to do or not do, and that means you would have to force others to follow you. i guess this is my problem with what you're saying here: what you're saying is a bit too close to the whole egalitarian conception of tolerance and humanism and equality and so on. it's not the same, but i could see it as a line of reasoning that could easily go down a really dangerous path. ""god has no religion"" sounds just a bit too much like a theological version of ""we all bleed red."" now, i remember we talked about something similar to this in my introduction thread, where you said that a sufi mystic and a christian ascetic can know and respect each other, but still they'd be against equality and humanism. but i never understood your actual reasoning behind that. how do you separate this from typical humanistic egalitarianism?   - - - - -   ultimately, i agree with you that god is above all else, and that this overriding truth is above all else (including the various shapes that the truth takes throughout the world). still, my attitude is one of ""we have to do what must be done."" do you see what i mean? ""we have to do what must be done"" is how i interpret all of this, which basically means that i am still happy about the downfall of islam. i can't not be.   i haven't read that evola book yet, but i'll try to find it because it looks very good from the information i've just gathered about it, and also i'll listen to that sufi audio later too. mysticism is always nice. :)   - - - - -   yazdanism   huh, sorry about that. i kinda‚Ä¶ neglected it. the thing is, i realized that if i do a write-up on yazdanism, i can't half-ass it. i can't just throw some random garbage in there and leave it at that, because that would be too disrespectful to my own faith, and it would also look stupid to the forum. but the problem is, if i do post a huge write-up (like one of slavros' big threads), then that would almost make me sound like i'm some sort of a ""regular contributor"" to iron march. does discussion of yazdanism belong on iron march, a european forum? i say, not really. mind you, i don't belong here either, and i only created this account to see if i could find other kurdish fascists. so that's why i was conflicted, and i ended up just neglecting it.   but of course, i can prepare a write-up for you if you care about it. i can send it to you in a pm, and i'd be fine with that. :d ",thank quick response see point problem group like isis understand islams inner essence outer substance add year furthermore also want destroy much outer substance would ultimately create black hole would almost nothing leave islam thus end result inevitable conclusion group act like isis final unification islam rather protestantization religion ten thousand different denomination word isis end unifying islam return muslim world root even though want spiritual strength instead break islam eventually cause demise like protestants christianity mean right line really stand minute ago vasiszta say people unable see essence unite substance divide every reformation lead mindless conflict keep remind protestants end different protestant denomination suppose happen effort reformation protestants see divide substance unite essence even though want purity reformation say return christianity true root reality simply spiritual strength carry monumental task protestantism end serve whatever local personal interest people within various group also remind saying buddha world become blind beat drum deathless basically talk involution essentially say return truth also protestants claim difference buddha actually spiritual strength carry task successful would say fair example also interesting buddha two thing mention better also care follow raise another question mind someone like hitler eventually force people follow mean hitler certainly qualify st requirement better however certainly qualify nd one least come masse know whole thing temporary period force listen organic state create political perspective religious one mean remember ustryalovs violence save die idea blah blah mean whole different issue also obviously fascist state always go lot thing would force people mean would force follow guess problem say say bit close whole egalitarian conception tolerance humanism equality could see line reasoning could easily go really dangerous path god religion sound bit much like theological version bleed red remember talk something similar introduction thread say sufi mystic christian ascetic know respect still would equality humanism never understand actual reasoning behind separate typical humanistic egalitarianism ultimately agree god else overriding truth else include various shape truth take throughout world still attitude one must see mean must interpret basically mean still happy downfall islam read evola book yet try find look good information gather also listen sufi audio later mysticism always nice yazdanism huh sorry kindaa neglect thing realize write yazdanism half ass throw random garbage leave would disrespectful faith would also look stupid forum problem post huge write like one slavros big thread would almost make sound like sort regular contributor iron march discussion yazdanism belong iron march european forum say really mind belong either create account see could find kurdish fascist conflict end neglect course prepare write care send pm would fine,0,0,origin,0.30840196261112096

7058," ser√ßava, gelek supas.   i understand what you mean about the forum's attitude toward kurds, and that's one of the reasons why i wasn't planning on creating an account in the first place. it was only once i saw you here that i decided that you and i must, must, must get in touch, and that's when i signed up in a heartbeat. otherwise, as you said, this place's benefit is mostly just in browsing its resources and materials. and in fact, i'm thinking of taking our conversation out of this forum soon anyway, and we should discuss kurdish fascism and the steps ahead of us in some other way. (and actually, i've already created a website for kurdish fascism, and i'm planning to add a forum to it soon. we can migrate and continue the conversation there. or, before that, we could continue the conversation through pms in some other website like reddit or something, and then we could migrate to the forum.)   regarding the empire and accomplishment thing‚Ä¶ you know, i see where you're coming from, but i'm not too worried about it. the way i think about it, i view the kurdish race as being currently in the same place where the germanic tribes used to be before the collapse of rome, or where the arabs used to be before mohammad‚Äîtoo surrounded by enemies who are too powerful and wealthy for them to counter. and while we're the barbarians of today, the so-called civilizations around us (the heirs of ottomans and achaemenids and caliphs) are drowning in decay and demoralization, especially the turks and arabs. all we need is for the right pieces to fall into the right place, and that's when we will get our chance to pounce. until then, it really is up to us (the kurds of today) to lay the roots of that fascist worldview that would then always be ready as the clearest and most final expression of the kurdish spirit, for both the near- and long-term future. and also for now too: since i really do see beauty and strength in the barbarian life of mountains and forests. in fact, a fascist state is by its nature going to be a barbarian state with only mere civilizational facades (i.e. the marriage of technology with nature), so its development from kurdistan's current situation seems to me to be very logical.   and by the way, these words of yours really struck me:   ""we are truly on our own, but we can turn our desolation among human civilisation to our advantage by creating a value system that answers to absolutely nothing and no one but us. i want the kurds to able to accept everything, true or false, that our detractors say about us, and still find the arrogance to spit in their faces.""   that is exactly what i've been thinking this whole time too, and it's also what i've been working on formulating for the past two years: a complete worldview of our own. i finished the worldview a few months ago, and i've now begun the serious effort to create kurdish fascism. you really need to join‚Äîor rather, i need you to join. remember the fasces: stronger together.   ---   about the assimilation thing, it's actually very admirable that even after a generation of lost kurds, you've still had the inner spirit to rise again. i have family members who live in kurdistan and speak kurdish and are immersed in the culture all day long, and yet they're not a quarter as nationalistic as you. i'm not disappointed at all‚Äîvery much the opposite, in fact. i'm actually wondering how you were able to rise up again? was it a singular event or a gradual return to your roots? do you have memories of kurdistan? do you go there? what's the story? i can sympathize because i too was almost assimilated into america when my family came to the us when i was 15, but over time i gradually returned to nationalism. i didn't have it as hard though, since we've always spoken kurdish and immersed by the culture, and since i was originally born in kurdistan (the south, specifically) in the first place.   oh, and what other languages do you speak, by the way? aside from english and kurdish, i also know a bit of arabic since it was mandatory in school back in kurdistan. and i'm also just like you when it comes to kurmanji: i'm just starting out learning it online, although i don't have informal tutors or anything.     ---     well, a lot of the kurds that i've met, at least the ones from southern kurdistan, tend to have fascist tendencies that are only cloaked under humanism for propaganda purposes. you're right about those humanistic arguments, and i've seen them myself too‚Äîbut only on tv and the internet and such. however, when you get down to it and talk to them quietly and alone, a lot of kurds (even older ones) can show extremely strong (but hidden) expressions of fascism and racism, especially when they're expressing themselves in kurdish, instead of english or some other language‚Äîso that may be another reason why our experiences have differed in this area. i've seen it so many times: i've seen people who would one moment give a speech in english about how turkey's murder of northern kurds is genocidal and violates ""human rights"", and in the next moment when you're alone with them they tell you in kurdish that they wish genocide on all of the world's turks. so yeah, that's what i meant by fascist tendencies: the hidden expression of higher truth is there, at their core, and it's just waiting for someone to carry it upward and bring it to the light. and as you said, nowadays this is gradually getting even more extreme and radical.   however, i have to say you're also very right about the slave/master conception, and that most kurds currently respond like slaves. that is exactly true, and it's one of the conclusions that i've reached as well: that we need to teach kurds (all the way from childhood) to think like masters no matter what the actual situation is, even if they're currently slaves. we need to develop that type of thinking and weltanschauung among kurds. it's going to take a lot of time (generations, perhaps) to fully seep in, but it's never too late, and the sooner we begin the better.
